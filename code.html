          <p>
            I chose the pair programming assignment because it easily taught me the importance of teamwork and
            communication when solving problems. At first both my partner and I felt defeated looking through the
            questions and navigating how to come up with solutions. I remember both of us trying to describe how to
            manipulate arrays and loops, while slowly coming to an understanding.

          <p>It became increasingly difficult when
            Dealing with the coins question, and in order to complete it we needed a full grasp of the content. Which we
            only attained by leaning on one another to code. While both of us would’ve been able to find the solution by
            ourselves, our collaboration made the process easier. Ultimately, it influenced my mindset to reach out to
            my fellow peers when I ran into issues, rather than believing I had to learn everything by myself.</p>

          <p>
            I chose my E-commerce site not only for its display of my creativity and color pallet, but also because of
            The growth I went through completing it. Originally, I felt extremely pressured to come up with an intricate
            design and that my website wouldn’t be good enough without it.

          <p>I decided to immediately start once given the
            assignment and settled on creating a slider using the JavaScript concepts I had just learned. I also had to
            research ways to customize my dividers, in order for the website to have more dimensions as you scroll down.
            I had to focus on the skills that would allow me to put my ideas on the site.</p>

            transitioning, and hero images. One of the most challenging parts of the project came towards the due date
            When I accidentally deleted my contact page as well as the hover effects on my products. It was extremely
            disheartening when I realized a lot of the work I put into disappeared last minute, yet it gave me a new
            mindset throughout the cohort. Since then I’ve made sure to keep copies of everything and anything new I’m working on, and to
            pace myself while working. As well as building habits to always go back to implement new skills learned.</p>
